# Recommendation Systems ðŸ“š

Welcome to the Recommendation Systems repository! This collection of scripts and case studies dives into various recommendation algorithms, including user-based, item-based, content-based, and model-based collaborative filtering. Each script provides practical insights and hands-on experience with different recommendation techniques. These exercises are part of the fifth week and fourth module of the Miuul Data Scientist Bootcamp.

## Contents ðŸ“‚

### 1. Association Rule Learning (ARL.py)
**Description:**
This script covers the association rule learning technique to identify relationships between items in transaction data. It includes data preprocessing, preparing ARL data structures, inferring association rules, and making product recommendations.

**Topics Covered:**
- Data Preprocessing
- Preparing ARL Data Structures
- Inferring Association Rules
- Making Product Recommendations

### 2. User-Based Collaborative Filtering (user_based_recommender.py)
**Description:**
This script implements user-based collaborative filtering to recommend items based on the similarity between users. It includes data preparation, finding similar users, and calculating weighted ratings for recommendations.

**Topics Covered:**
- Data Preparation
- Similarity Calculation
- Score Calculation
- Making Recommendations

### 3. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (item_based_recommender.py)
**Description:**
This script implements item-based collaborative filtering to recommend items based on the similarity between items. It includes data preparation, creating a user-movie matrix, and making item-based movie recommendations.

**Topics Covered:**
- Data Preparation
- Creating User-Movie Matrix
- Making Item-Based Recommendations

### 4. Content-Based Recommendation (content_based_recommender.py)
**Description:**
This script implements content-based recommendation to recommend items based on the content similarity between items. It includes creating a TF-IDF matrix, creating a cosine similarity matrix, and making recommendations based on similarities.

**Topics Covered:**
- Creating TF-IDF Matrix
- Creating Cosine Similarity Matrix
- Making Recommendations Based on Similarities

### 5. Model-Based Collaborative Filtering: Matrix Factorization (matrix_factorization.py)
**Description:**
This script implements matrix factorization using the SVD algorithm to make recommendations. It includes data preparation, modeling, model tuning, and making predictions.

**Topics Covered:**
- Data Preparation
- Modeling with SVD
- Model Tuning
- Making Predictions

## Final Thoughts ðŸ’¡
These exercises have been instrumental in enhancing my understanding of various recommendation algorithms. By tackling real-world problems, I have learned how to apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios, making data-driven recommendations more effectively. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone looking to deepen their knowledge of recommender systems and Python programming. Feel free to explore, experiment, and modify the examples to enhance your learning experience!
